/*
 * Main class for processing student, module, and attendance data.
 * (Implementation removed as requested.)
 *
 * TODO List:
 *
 * Data Acquisition & Access:
 *   - [ ] QlikView:
 *     - [ ] Access Student by Programme with Registration Status (Filter: UG, Main Campus, Reg Status != Withdrawn~)
 *     - [ ] Access Component Due Dates By Block
 *     - [ ] Access Student on Module by Registration Status
 *     - [ ] Download current year cohort registration status.
 *     - [ ] Download last 4 academic years EBR data for L4/5/6 (check CRN linkage).
 *   - [ ] Step (Jisc):
 *     - [ ] Clarify data structure with Chris (student-based vs. module-based).
 *     - [ ] Obtain engagement & attendance data.
 *     - [ ] Download last year JISC attendance T1 and T2 files.
 *     - [ ] Download current year T1 JISC file.
 *   - [ ] Blackboard:
 *     - [ ] Obtain admin access.
 *     - [ ] Access submission time data (module-based).
 *   - [ ] Gradebook:
 *     - [ ] Get access for pass/fail checks.
 *   - [ ] Exam Board Reporter (EBR):
 *     - [ ] Request access (AC TRAINING).
 *     - [ ] Download reports based on CRN (from QlikView).
 *     - [ ] Understand report views (Admin/Panel/History).
 *   - [ ] Source Document:
 *     - [ ] Use for component DDL & IYR Date Assessments Tabs.
 *     - [ ] Get LEAF module list for Law cohorts.
 *   - [ ] IYR List:
 *     - [ ] Obtain IYR list for entire SBS.
 *   - [ ] Verify Level 3 data sources.
 *
 * Data Integration & Processing:
 *   - [ ] Integrate Blackboard submission data to be student-based (using network ID).
 *   - [ ] Integrate Jisc data if module-based.
 *   - [ ] Link data across sources (QlikView CRN, Network ID, etc.).
 *   - [ ] Process QlikView data to identify:
 *     - [ ] Student Level
 *     - [ ] Submission dates
 *     - [ ] Last year progression (Resit status: RP/RE)
 *     - [ ] Modules per student
 *   - [ ] Process Jisc data for:
 *     - [ ] Attendance %
 *     - [ ] Engagement %
 *     - [ ] Last year Attendance & Engagement %
 *   - [ ] Process Blackboard data for:
 *     - [ ] Non-submission/late submission flags.
 *   - [ ] Process Gradebook data for pass/fail status.
 *   - [ ] Process EBR data for resit outcomes (** marker).
 *   - [ ] Handle PMC/RAP cases (check data, potentially exclude initially).
 *
 * Priority Group Identification (Initialize yearly, update per trimester/trigger):
 *   - [ ] Identify Level 3 & 4 students (Target: 2 meetings/trimester).
 *   - [ ] Identify students trailing a module (QlikView: additional retake module).
 *   - [ ] Identify students repeating the year with attendance (QlikView: Reg Status=RP).
 *   - [ ] Identify students who engaged in IYR last year (Submission date between DDL & resit + passed). (Note: No IYR for L3 now).
 *   - [ ] Identify students who progressed through resit period (Submission date after IYR + passed).
 *   - [ ] Identify students with < 70% engagement last year/trimester (Jisc).
 *   - [ ] Identify students engaging in IYR in the current year (L4 only, post-DDL).
 *   - [ ] Identify T2 students carrying a fail from T1 (For T2 start only).
 *   - [ ] Update priority group based on PMC status (P, R, RR).
 *
 * Implementation & Verification:
 *   - [ ] Start implementation with Law Programme data.
 *   - [ ] Follow with Business Management (BM) cohort.
 *   - [ ] Verify priority group logic and results with C.
 *   - [ ] Ensure all required data is shared via Teams channel.
 *
 * Future Work:
 *   - [ ] Incorporate PMC/RAP data analysis.
