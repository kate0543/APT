## Project Background

The APT project was developed at Salford Business School, University of Salford, to provide a robust framework for automating and managing tasks in academic and professional environments. It aims to simplify workflows and enhance productivity through modular and extensible tools.

## Classes and Usage

### Core Classes

- **TaskManager**: Handles the creation, scheduling, and execution of tasks.
- **AutomationEngine**: Provides the core logic for automating repetitive processes.
- **ReportGenerator**: Generates detailed reports based on task execution and outcomes.

### Usage

1. Import the required modules into your project.
2. Initialize the `TaskManager` to define and manage tasks.
3. Use the `AutomationEngine` to automate workflows.
4. Generate reports using the `ReportGenerator` for insights and analysis.

Example:
```python
from apt.task_manager import TaskManager
from apt.automation_engine import AutomationEngine

# Initialize TaskManager
task_manager = TaskManager()

# Define tasks
task_manager.add_task("Backup Files", "backup_script.sh")

# Automate tasks
engine = AutomationEngine(task_manager)
engine.run()
```
